%This function checks if the DMM has an error in its error queue.
%This is to be used with all .m example files for the 34460A/34461A
%Checks if there is an error in the queue. If yes, the, it continuously
%checks the queue until there is no error and throws and exception.
%Reports all errors in the exception.

%The command sent to the instrument is "SYST:ERR". If the returned string
%from the DMM contains "No error" the function returns. If if does not
%contain "No error", it will continue to send and read the SYST:ERR
%responses until "No error" is received. All the errors then are reported
%in the exception message.
